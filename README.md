# Why place AddToAny on my site?

With the majority of sharing activity not coming from the largest sharing destinations (Facebook, Twitter, email), an all-inclusive sharing platform and reliable sharing service is a requirement for nearly all websites. AddToAny is that platform and service. Launched in March 2006, AddToAny is the very first universal sharing platform, and the customizable sharing platform that makes it easy for visitors to share and bookmark your content using any service, resulting in:

    More traffic
    Easy distribution
    Better rankings
    Extended reach

Get the sharing buttons for your website, content management system or blog, including WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and many other platforms.
