# zen_AddToAny
AddToAny for Zen Cart. AddToAny is the ORIGINAL sharing platform service. It is superior to AddThis sharing platform service for a few reasons:
* No need to create a separate account JUST to track social analytics. AddToAny automatically integrates with Google Analytics, and integrates with other analytics software as well. If you are using AddToAny on a page that uses Google Analytics, the statistics roll in on their own.
* AddToAny is now and always has been free. There will be no crippling of services to push a commercial product when using AddToAny
* Completely customizable

This module is a simple implementation of AddToAny. Using the customization guide you can do a lot more with the AddToAny API.. Eventually I will build out an admin configuration menu and provide more customization options (including vertical sharing buttons) from within the Zen Cart admin

# To Install
* Unzip the file. 
* Re-name the **templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE** to match the name of your template. 
* Copy the contents of the **zen_AddToAny** folder to your store (repeat copy the CONTENTS of the **zen_AddToAny** folder -- do NOT copy the **zen_AddToAny** folder to your store).
* If you have a custom tpl_product_info_display.php file, merge the /includes/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE/templates/tpl_product_info_display.php file with the one in your template.

THAT'S IT!!!

# Why place AddToAny on my site?
With the majority of sharing activity not coming from the largest sharing destinations (Facebook, Twitter, email), an all-inclusive sharing platform and reliable sharing service is a requirement for nearly all websites. AddToAny is that platform and service. Launched in March 2006, AddToAny is the very first universal sharing platform, and the customizable sharing platform that makes it easy for visitors to share and bookmark your content using any service, resulting in:

    More traffic
    Easy distribution
    Better rankings
    Extended reach

Get the sharing buttons for your website, content management system or blog, including WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and many other platforms.

# What features does AddToAny have?
AddToAny has many features, yet remains lightweight and efficient. We carefully launch new features, and we retire obsolete features. Popular built-in features include:

    Vector sharing icons in any size made for mobile, tablets, touchscreen devices, Retina and high-DPI displays
    Traditional sharing icons in a standard size (16px)
    Optimized performance and efficient loading via world-class CDNs
    Universal sharing button and smart menu
    Visitor personalization
    Google Analytics integration
    International support (i18n/localization)
    Accessibility and graceful degradation
    Cross-browser and backwards compatibility
    Complete control for publishers & developers of all sizes


# How do I get usage statistics?
AddToAny automatically integrates with Google Analytics, and integrates with other analytics software. If you are using AddToAny on a page that uses Google Analytics, the statistics roll in on their own. See AddToAny & Google Analytics (https://www.addtoany.com/ext/google_analytics/) for details on how to access these stats within Google Analytics. Other analytics software can track sharing usage by hooking into AddToAny events (https://www.addtoany.com/buttons/customize/events).

To track clickthrus on shared links (https://www.addtoany.com/buttons/customize/link_tracking), AddToAny integrates with link shorteners and custom URLs and parameters (including Google Analytics parameters).


# Does the code validate?
AddToAny generates fully W3C valid HTML5 and (X)HTML code. Official AddToAny plugins are also W3C compliant.

# How do I customize AddToAny?
Start with the documentation for customizing AddToAny. https://www.addtoany.com/buttons/customize/


# Can I host the buttons myself?
Yes, feel free!

# Can I create my own buttons?
Certainly, and when you do, we would love for you to add them to the buttons pool on Flickr.
